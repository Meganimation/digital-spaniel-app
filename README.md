# Getting Started with Create React App

<p> started with basic architecture, chose not to use grids on basis that i have not used them before and do not want a potential roadblock down the road or risk not being able to talk about my process
-began blocking out each component by seperating the heroes into pages
-then added basis positioning
-added background colors to make life easier
-created nav bar with right and left float, not yet stickied
-added psuedo selectors to links before i forget to
-added a name context hook just because. 
-began creating cards for multi use, including some embedded css such as padding
-started adding media queries
-XD sheet specifies some hard pixels for largeDesktop, which makes anything below largeDesktop look weird.
-decided to match the specs for largeDesktop and then edit them for laptop, so the UX designer doesn't feel ignored
-why do I always have issues with getting the typeface right?
-added breakpoints and interpolated them, making viewports easier to manage
-started passing props into the card component
-imported images into public and direct, need to learn how to lazy-load
-perhaps i should build a loading screen?
-seperated card and title so Heading can be reused more
-adding in flipcard images but no text yet
-added basic carousel with data, buttons needs adding
-downloaded and embedded appropriate fonts
-started matching font weights
-added animated underline for links
-added a collage using flexbox
-created seperate card components for testemonials with info to pass in as props
-animated cards
-added state functionality to buttons
-a lot of flip-flop css
-need to add themese
-created collage
-tried using refs but they wont work on styled components for some reason
-added margins
-added animations to links, cards, carousel, etc
-removed skeleton bg colors
-added padding
-adding state functionalities
-began css for various media queries
-created hamburger menu logic
-styled hamburger using svgs
-added opacity and positioning animation for menu
-created function to seperate heading into two lines if need be
-added router




things I know how to do but might not have time to: 
-themes
-context 
-better naming conventions
-more slide buttons
-lazy loading



things im unsure about/need to learn more of:
-how to work with images without guessing the css alot (how embarrassing...)
-working with flex grids
-possibly a better way to implement hamburger menu
-how to build a carousel from scratch
-sticky nav with offset (im thinking of adding a function with an event listener that looks out for when window.scrollUp is in effect, then after 500 or so, set position to sticky-top/fixed)
-better planning/architecture (should have used storybook and built via AAA development but I got cheeky and rushed the architect stage)
-best css implementations for large landing pages
-how to stitch each page together


notes to mention incase I forget:

-device.desktop matches the XD specs and are therefore in px, otherwise other vp's are in vh which arent as accurate, but are more dynamic
-different techniques were used accross the bored, to show the different variations of my dev level and different ways to complete the same task
-my personal thoughts? i do not think this code shows 5 years of dev experience, but I think with more time and planning, i could get close
-i wanted to use storybook but thought against it as I know it is not implemented in this role, this made things a bit difficult/unusual for me, and if i was to redo it, i would have used it
-i had a LOT of fun doing this, but should have been more serious with my naming convenction
-probs could have done better file placement too
