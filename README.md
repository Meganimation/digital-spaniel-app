# Getting Started with Create React App

<p> started with basic architecture, chose not to use grids on basis that i have not used them before and do not want a potential roadblock down the road or risk not being able to talk about my process
-began blocking out each component by seperating the heroes into pages
-then added basis positioning
-added background colors to make life easier
-created nav bar with right and left float, not yet stickied
-added psuedo selectors to links before i forget to
-added a name context hook just because. 
-began creating cards for multi use, including some embedded css such as padding
-started adding media queries
-XD sheet specifies some hard pixels for largeDesktop, which makes anything below largeDesktop look weird.
-decided to match the specs for largeDesktop and then edit them for laptop, so the UX designer doesn't feel ignored
-why do I always have issues with getting the typeface right?
-added breakpoints and interpolated them, making viewports easier to manage
-started passing props into the card component
-imported images into public and direct, need to learn how to lazy-load
-perhaps i should build a loading screen?
-seperated card and title so Heading can be reused more
-adding in flipcard images but no text yet
